# Does it really rain a lot in Seattle?

This repository contains code analyzing Seattle's rain from 1948 to 2017. The data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/did-it-rain-in-seattle-19482017). A blog post summarizing more details can be found [here](https://joshuagoldberg.name/post/seattle-rain/).

Goal of analysis and blog post is to address the following questions about Seattle's rain:

- What frequency does it rain?
- How much actual rainfall occurs (measured in percipitation/inches)?
- Are there seasonal trends of rain?
- Can we predict whether it will rain on a given day with the available data?
